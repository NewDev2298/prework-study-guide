# <First-Of-Many>
## Description

- My biggest motivation for this project has been my desire to take the first step in becoming a legitimate web developer.
- This website was created to help organize all notes and tips learned in the pre-work for my upcoming coding bootcamp.
- The project helps list all information in one place and makes said information easy to access. 
- This process helped provide a general overview of the main components in creating successful code. I learned concepts like HTML, Javascript, CSS and much more. Learned how to use Terminal and apply that knowledge to help bring the project to life.

## Usage

- Use this Prework Study Guide to review the notes in each section. 
- For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
